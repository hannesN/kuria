# What is Kuria #

_Kuria_ provides a set of java annotations and a parser to generate bindings for widget classes. These bindings are used to input masks, tables and trees for the annotated domain model.

Feel free to try _Kuria_.

It is strongly advise to use Kuria inside eclipse plug-ins or maven projects.
