== SWT Generator ==

=== Introduction ===
The SWT Generator is used to generate widgets based in the bindings. These widgets are generated with the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) and
a wrapper library called JFace. Both libraries are part of the Eclipse Project. See http://eclipse.org/swt/ for more information. 

To use the generated widgets a parent widget is needed. This could be a *Shell*, which is the class representing a window or a *Composite*.

To generate one of the three main widgets instantiate the class *WidgetGenerator* and call the generation methods.

=== Tables ===
A TableBinding is realized using the class *TableViewer*. See http://www.jdocs.com/eclipse/3.2/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TableViewer.html for
more information. The table viewer uses the ColumnBinding and generates the needed content providers.

The input of the *TableViewer*, set with the method *setInput* must be a Collection of the annotated model class.

To generate a *TableViewer* call the method *generateTable*. The method exists with two or three parameters:

 * *Class<?> clazz* the class object which binding is used
 * *Composite parent* the parent widget, which should be a composite or shell
 * *IContextMenuListener contextMenuListener* a listener which generates actions for a context menu for the table
