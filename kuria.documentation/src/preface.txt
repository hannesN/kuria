Writing User interfaces is a time consuming and repeating task. Most input masks for a model have the same layout
which consists of a label, which indicates the editable property and a widget to edit the value of the property.

Most properties use a text field for editing. If the property of any type of number, the input mask might only 
accept digits. This behaviour has to be added to any text field of  property.

Another feature of input masks is the validation of the data. Even simple validation like checking if a value was 
entered needs additional code, which repeats for every widget which is used.

_Kuria_ provides an automatic way of creating UI widgets based on a given domain model.
_Kuria is split in three parts:

* *kuria.runtime* specifies some binding interfaces and classes to communication between the widget and a domain model property
* *kuria.generator* provides classes to generate the ui widgets. right now only SWT is supported
* *kuria.annotation* provides a set of annottion which can be used to configure the domain model properties fir the generator
